# CS180-Direct-Messaging-Project-Anay-Ryan-Pranav-Tanya-

Phase 1 of the Project contains 3 major components: User, Message and the Database (data is stored as files - instead of a database class instance)

The user class is the central class of the program and it has a bunch of uitilty functions for the current and later versions of the program.
The message class basically instantiates messages of either of 2 types - image (extra credit) or text- and assigns them to the user who sent them. The Database is created by the User class each time it is referenced in the main Application (will be submitted in the future)                                             
Finally the test cases check each and every utility function of the User and Message classes and if the files that comprise the database are updated/modified correctly

To actually see how the program is working, you must run the provided test cases. That is pretty much all one needs to check the work done in Phase 1.

A solid foundation has been laid for Phase 2 of the project by the work done in Phase 1. We look forward to implementing the server side of the project in the next iteration of our work!
